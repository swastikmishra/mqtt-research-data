I want a golang script to run load tests on my mqtt brokers.

I want to pass the following configs through ENV variable:
- testCode
- totalUsers
- rampUpRate
- qos
- messageSizeKB
- publishRatePerSec
- testDurationMins

Read the number of available brokers in brokers.json file under app/ and then start load testing as per the configuration
